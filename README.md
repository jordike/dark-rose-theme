# My Custom Theme
This theme is my own personal theme. It is the first theme I have ever made,
and was made to support my own needs. Therefore, I cannot guarantee the theme
to work with other technologies you use.

## Supported Languages
This theme has been and tested with the following programming
languages:

* C
* C++
* C#
* CSS
* HTML
* Java
* JavaScript
* JSon
* Markdown
* PHP
* Rust
* TypeScript

The theme *may* work with other programming languages, but they
have not been tested. The theme was made first and foremost to support
my needs, however you may use it if you want.

## Demo Files
The files in the ``theme_test_files`` directory were used to test
the theme. **The code used is not mine, and belong to their respective owners.**
I do not claim ownership over those.
All of them originate from diverse GitHub repositories. They were taken from random
repositories in their respective languages, sorted by stars.

Only three files used are mine, those are:

* The CSS file
* The HTML file
* and the JSON file

## Name
This theme is named after my online username, Valatos. As far as I know, it's not
a real word and does not have a meaning. If it does, then know that's not intended.

# Valatos' Theme
This theme is my own personal theme. It is the first theme I have ever made,
and *was made to support my own needs*. Therefore, I cannot guarantee the theme
to work with other technologies you use.

## Themes
This theme consists of a dark theme and a light theme. The theme has been developed
with the dark theme, so this is the one best supported.

There is also a light theme, however, but that one is still being worked on. It is
released already so I can use it and fix mistakes as they appear.

## Supported Languages
This theme has been and tested with the following programming
languages:

* C
* C++
* C#
* CMake
* CSS
* HTML
* Java
* JavaScript
* JSon
* Markdown
* PHP
* Rust
* TypeScript

The theme *may* work with other programming languages, but they
have not been tested. The theme was made first and foremost to support
my needs, however you may use it if you want.

## Name
This theme is named after my online username, Valatos. As far as I know, it's not
a real word and does not have a meaning. If it does, then know that's not intended.
